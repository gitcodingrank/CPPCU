Problem Statement:
🎯 Student Task: Banking System

💡 Task Description:

Create a Bank Account system using C++ encapsulation and Inheritance where:

1. The account balance is private and cannot be accessed directly.
2. Users can deposit money, but only if the amount is positive.
3. Users can withdraw money, but only if they have sufficient balance.
4. The system should display the account holder's name and balance.

📝 Task Requirements

- Use a class named `BankAccount` with private variables:
    - `accountHolder` (string)
    - `balance` (double)
- Implement getter and setter functions:
    - `deposit(double amount)` → Adds money if amount > 0
    - `withdraw(double amount)` → Deducts money if balance is sufficient
    - `getBalance()` → Returns the account balance
- Create a menu-driven program to interact with the user.
