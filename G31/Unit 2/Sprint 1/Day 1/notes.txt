Object Oriented Programming:

C++ supports various programming paradigm(way or style), which are given below.
1. Procedural Oriented Programming
2. Functional Programming
3. Object Oriented Programming.

Why - Object Oriented Programming?

In Real World, Everything is object, every object has two common things:
1. How they look? - properties/attributes/states
2. How they act? - features/functions/methods

Example: 
Real World Object: Mobile
1. How they look? - properties/attributes/states
    mobileModelName
    brandName
    backCamera
    frontCamera
    storage
    RAM
    display
2. How they act? - features/functions/methods
    playMusic()
    watchNetflixSeries()
    clickPhotos()
    readNotes()

Real World Object: Account
1. How they look? - properties/attributes/states
    accountHoderName
    bankName
    currentBalance
    accountNumber
    ifscCode
    accountType
2. How they act? - features/functions/methods
    depositeAmount()
    withdrwalAmount()
    checkBalance()
    checkLoanEligibility()

To Understand, why do we need Object Oriented Programming, Check the blow example using functional and procedural oriented programming.

Problem Statement: Create an application which can maintain the functionality around bank account.

Solution:
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

//2. how it looks? - properties/attributes/states
double balance=0;
string accountNumber = "123456789";



//object: account
//1. how it acts? - functionalities/features/behaviors

string depositMoney(string accountNumber, int amount){
    //logic to deposit amount
}

string withdrawMoney(string accountNumber, int amount){
    //logic to withdraw amount
}

string checkBalance(string accountNumber){
    //logic to check amount
}

int main(){

  //write code here

}

But in above, problem, our data and functions are seperatly written which are not good as per security and industry standard, such code can promote following issues.

1. Lack of security/data hiding/abstraction
2. Lack of Reusability
3. Lack of modularity/structured

Here, your Object Oriented Programming solves all above problems and promotoes object as first citizen to create real world application.

Object Oriented Programming: It is one the most famous programming paradigm where you can keep functions/behaviors and properties/state inside one class and create multilple object, such code promotes Reusability, Security, and Modularity to build any real world applicaton.
