### **Problem 5:** Vehicle Management System Using Inheritance

 ****You need to design a Vehicle Management System using hierarchical inheritance. Implement a base class `Vehicle` that defines common vehicle properties. Then, derive two subclasses:

- **Car**: Represents a car with attributes: model name, fuel capacity (in liters), mileage (km per liter), and seating capacity.
- **Bike**: Represents a bike with attributes: model name, engine capacity (cc), mileage (km per liter), and type (sports/cruiser).

Your program should allow users to store vehicle details and display them.

**Input Format:**

- The first line contains an integer `N` (number of vehicles).
- Each of the next `N` lines contains:
    - `"car model fuel_capacity mileage seating_capacity"` (for cars)
    - `"bike model engine_capacity mileage type"` (for bikes)

**Output Format:**

1. For each **Car**, output:
    
    ```
    Vehicle Type: Car
    Model: <model>
    Fuel Capacity: <fuel_capacity> L
    Mileage: <mileage> km/l
    Seating Capacity: <seating_capacity>
    ```
    
2. For each **Bike**, output:
    
    ```
    Vehicle Type: Bike
    Model: <model>
    Engine Capacity: <engine_capacity> cc
    Mileage: <mileage> km/l
    Type: <type>
    ```
    

Each vehicle's details should be printed separately.

**Constraints:**

- `1 ≤ N ≤ 100` (Number of vehicles)
- `5 ≤ fuel_capacity ≤ 100` (for cars)
- `50 ≤ engine_capacity ≤ 2000` (for bikes)
- `5 ≤ mileage ≤ 50` (for both cars and bikes)
- `2 ≤ seating_capacity ≤ 7` (for cars)
- `type` can be either "sports" or "cruiser" (for bikes).
- Model names contain only lowercase English letters and numbers.

**Sample Test Cases**

**Test Case 1** (Basic Test with One Car and One Bike)

**Input:**

```
2
car swift 45 20 5
bike ninja 650 25 sports
```

**Output:**

```
Vehicle Type: Car
Model: swift
Fuel Capacity: 45 L
Mileage: 20 km/l
Seating Capacity: 5

Vehicle Type: Bike
Model: ninja
Engine Capacity: 650 cc
Mileage: 25 km/l
Type: sports
```

**Explanation:**

- Car `swift` has fuel capacity 45L, mileage 20 km/l, seating for 5.
- Bike `ninja` has engine capacity 650cc, mileage 25 km/l, type sports.

**Test Case 2** (Multiple Vehicles)

**Input:**

```
3
car tesla 80 30 5
bike ducati 1200 18 sports
car bmw 60 22 4
```

**Output:**

```
Vehicle Type: Car
Model: tesla
Fuel Capacity: 80 L
Mileage: 30 km/l
Seating Capacity: 5

Vehicle Type: Bike
Model: ducati
Engine Capacity: 1200 cc
Mileage: 18 km/l
Type: sports

Vehicle Type: Car
Model: bmw
Fuel Capacity: 60 L
Mileage: 22 km/l
Seating Capacity: 4
```
