## Problem 1: Smart Home Device Management Using Virtual Functions

You are developing a **Smart Home Device Management System** where multiple types of smart devices (e.g., Smart Lights, Smart Locks, and Smart Thermostats) are controlled. The system should use **virtual functions** to ensure each device type implements its own method of displaying information dynamically.

Create the following **class hierarchy**:

- **SmartDevice (Base Class - Abstract Class)**
    
    Stores `device ID` and provides a **pure virtual function** `displayInfo()`.
    
- **SmartLight (Derived from SmartDevice)**
    
    Stores **brightness level** (0–100%) and overrides `displayInfo()`.
    
- **SmartLock (Derived from SmartDevice)**
    
    Stores **lock status** (Locked/Unlocked) and overrides `displayInfo()`.
    
- **SmartThermostat (Derived from SmartDevice)**
    
    Stores **current temperature** (in °C) and overrides `displayInfo()`.
    

Your program should allow **inputting multiple Smart Devices** and display them **dynamically using virtual functions**.

### Input Format:

- The first line contains an integer `N` (number of smart devices).
- The next `N` lines contain details in the format:

```
device_type device_ID additional_info
```

Where:

- `device_type`: `"Light"`, `"Lock"`, or `"Thermostat"`
- `device_ID`: Alphanumeric string (max length 10)
- `additional_info`:
    - If `Light`, enter **brightness level** (0–100%)
    - If `Lock`, enter `"Locked"` or `"Unlocked"`
    - If `Thermostat`, enter **temperature** in Celsius

---

### Output Format:

For each Smart Device, print:

```
Smart Device Details:
Device ID: <device_ID>
<Specific Details>
```

Each device's details should be printed separately.

---

### Constraints:

- `1 ≤ N ≤ 100`
- `device_ID` is an alphanumeric string (max length 10).
- **brightness level**: `0 ≤ level ≤ 100`
- **lock status**: `"Locked"` or `"Unlocked"`
- **temperature**: `50 ≤ temperature ≤ 50 (in °C)`

---

### Sample Test Cases:

### Test Case 1: Basic Test Case

**Input:**

```
1
Light D123 75
```

**Output:**

```
Smart Device Details:
Device ID: D123
Brightness Level: 75%
```

**Explanation:**

• The smart light `D123` has a brightness level of 75%.

---

### Test Case 2: Multiple Devices

**Input:**

```
3
Lock S567 Locked
Thermostat T890 22
Light L345 40
```

**Output:**

```
Smart Device Details:
Device ID: S567
Lock Status: Locked
Smart Device Details:
Device ID: T890
Current Temperature: 22°C
Smart Device Details:
Device ID: L345
Brightness Level: 40%
```

**Explanation:**

• The `S567` smart lock is Locked.

• The `T890` smart thermostat is set at 22°C.

• The `L345` smart light is at 40% brightness.
