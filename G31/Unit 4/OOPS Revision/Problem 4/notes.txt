### **Problem 4: Smart Payment System Using Polymorphism**

You are developing a Smart Payment System that supports multiple payment methods (Credit Card, Digital Wallet, and UPI). The system should use polymorphism to handle different payment methods dynamically.

Create the following class hierarchy:

1. **Payment** (Base Class - Abstract Class): Stores transaction ID and provides a pure virtual function `processPayment()`.
2. **CreditCard** (Derived from Payment): Stores card number (last 4 digits) and overrides `processPayment()`.
3. **DigitalWallet** (Derived from Payment): Stores wallet provider (PayPal, Paytm, Google Pay, etc.) and overrides `processPayment()`.
4. **UPI** (Derived from Payment): Stores UPI ID and overrides `processPayment()`.

Your program should allow inputting multiple payment transactions and display their details dynamically using polymorphism.

### **Input Format:**

- The first line contains an integer `N` (number of payment transactions).
- The next `N` lines contain details in the format:

```
payment_type transaction_ID additional_info
```

- `payment_type`: "CreditCard", "DigitalWallet", or "UPI"
- `transaction_ID`: Alphanumeric string (max length 12)
- `additional_info`:
    - If `CreditCard`, enter last 4 digits of the card.
    - If `DigitalWallet`, enter wallet provider (PayPal, Paytm, Google Pay, etc.).
    - If `UPI`, enter UPI ID.

---

### **Output Format:**

For each Payment Transaction, print:

```
Payment Details:
Transaction ID: <transaction_ID>
<Specific Details>
```

Each transaction's details should be printed separately.

---

### **Constraints:**

- `1 ≤ N ≤ 100`
- `transaction_ID` is an alphanumeric string (max length 12).
- `card number`: 4-digit number (`1000 ≤ number ≤ 9999`).
- `wallet provider`: Alphanumeric string (max length 15).
- `UPI ID`: Alphanumeric string (max length 20).

### **Sample Test Cases**

### **Test Case 1 (Basic Test Case)**

**Input:**

```
1
CreditCard TXN123 5678
```

**Output:**

```
Payment Details:
Transaction ID: TXN123
Credit Card Last 4 Digits: 5678
```

**Explanation:**

- The payment `TXN123` was made using a Credit Card with last 4 digits `5678`.

---

### **Test Case 2 (Multiple Transactions)**

**Input:**

```
3
UPI TXN789 abc@upi
DigitalWallet TXN456 Paytm
CreditCard TXN999 4321
```

**Output:**

```
Payment Details:
Transaction ID: TXN789
UPI ID: abc@upi

Payment Details:
Transaction ID: TXN456
Digital Wallet Provider: Paytm

Payment Details:
Transaction ID: TXN999
Credit Card Last 4 Digits: 4321
```
