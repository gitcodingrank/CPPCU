    As in above code, your prime number logic is repeating again and again that is promoting dupicacy or redundancy in your code.

    To reduce dulicacy and promote reusability, we can create a block of that repeated code.

    primeNumber{
      prime number logic
    }
    

     Function: It is a block of code related to specific functionality/task, which is used to reuse that particular block of code again and again rather than writing from the sctrach.

     Declartion of function in C++:
     
     Syntax:
     data_type functionName(){
       //block of code related to specific task.
     }

Function Parameters and Arguments:

Function Parameters: They are function variables/parameters which are used within function only and we define at the time declaration of a function.

Function Arguments: They are actual value/data that we pass to the function variables/parameters at the time calling a function.

Note: Function can also return something using 'return' keyword
